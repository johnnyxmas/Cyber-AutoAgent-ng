  Analyze the following log of an agentic workflow and describe where the agent struggled and offer recommendations for improvements. \
  Provide a summary of the workflow at the beginning to help the reader under the context of your analysis. \
  $@ \
  The system prompt is logged with the tag "system_prompt_payload" as it is optimized by the agent. Include recommendations for improvement to the system prompt. \
  The agent is given a budget of steps. If the agent did not fully utilize the budget, determine the reason and provide recommendations. \
  Evaluate if task_management was followed: if not, offer an explanation. \
  If specialized tools are included in the system prompt, determine if the agent used those tools effectively and offer recommendations for better specialized tool use. \
  Offer recommendations for writing custom tools that chain together other tools in predicable patterns, only if there is a benefit beyond the model reasoning itself and the custom tool would be generally useful. \
